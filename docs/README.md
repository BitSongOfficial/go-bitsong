# BitSong Network Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the **BitSong Network**

**BitSong** is a new music platform, which will be built using the **[Cosmos-SDK](https://cosmos.network/)** and the **[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)** distribuited filesystem.

Our mission is to enable a simple global blockchain infrastructure that empowers the music industry.

- **Upload your music**. Upload all your productions via **[BitSong](https://bitsong.io)**, your music will be saved on **[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)** an immutable and distributed storage.
- **Blockchain Distribution**. Your music will be distributed via BitSong on all its clients. For each track listened, you will receive a real-time **BTSG** reward.
- **Immutable streams**. Thanks to blockchain technology, each stream will be recorded and impossible to modify.
- **Payments in real time**. When one of your tunes is listened to, ***you will be rewarded in real time in BTSG, and your fans will receive a portion of your profits.***
- **Tokenize your productions**. Tokenize your productions, receive new investments for your new productions and share your rewards with all your fans.
- **Distributied Governance**. Distributed governance means that there is no element that can make decisions independently.
